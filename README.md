# OpenCV Warp Perspective Transformation

This repository contains two Python scripts that demonstrate perspective transformation using OpenCV. Both scripts allow you to select four points on an image to perform a perspective warp and obtain a new view of the image or a live video stream.

## Perspective Transformation on Live Video

### Requirements

To run the script `mouseimpl.py`, you need the following installed:

- Python 3
- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy

### Usage

1. Place the image you want to transform in the `Resources` folder.
2. Run the script `mouseimpl.py`.
3. Click on four points in the displayed image to select the region of interest for the perspective transformation.
4. Once you have selected four points, the script will perform the perspective transformation and display the output image.
